# Computer Vision Basics 

This repository contains my implementation of basic Computer Vision codes in Python and MATLAB. The implemented algorithms include:

Python (OpenCV): 
1. Watershed segmentation
2. Canny edge detection
3. Contour detection 
4. Estimation of object width using Raspberry Pi Camera and LIDAR sensor

MATLAB
1. Image thresholding 
2. Colour extraction and binarisation
3. Distance between centroids
